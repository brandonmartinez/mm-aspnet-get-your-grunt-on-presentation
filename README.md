# Grunt Through Your Next ASP.NET App

## Presentation Abstract

Visual Studio 2015 is a perfect representation of the new Microsoft: bringing the existing .NET Framework together with open source tools, your productivity is no longer hindered on waiting for the next VS update.

Now available in the 2015 release is the ability to work with external tool chains. In this session, we’ll be focusing on using Node, NPM, Grunt, and Bower in combination with a new ASP.NET DNX web app. We’ll see how these two stacks can integrate into a single application, and how we can deploy these out to a cloud service like Microsoft Azure.
